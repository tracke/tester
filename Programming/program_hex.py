""" 

    This file contains example code meant to be used in order to test the 
    pynrfjprog API and Hex. If multiple devices are connected, pop-up will appear.
    
    Sample program: program_hex.py
    Requires nrf51-DK or nrf52-DK for visual confirmation (LEDs).
    
    Run from command line:  
        python program_hex.py  
    or if imported as "from pynrfjprog import examples"
        examples.program_hex.run()
    
    Program flow:
        0. API is opened and checked to see if correct family type is used
        1. Memory is erased
        2. test_program_path is parsed and written to memory
        3. Device is reset and application is run
